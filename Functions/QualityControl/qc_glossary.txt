This is an explanation what qc_glossary.tsv does. 

qc_glossary.tsv contains a list of qc quality parameters from x.Output with string replacements to be used in xASL_qc_GenerateReport.
Each row is a tab separated entry with the following (sometimes empty) fields:
parameter	Alias	Description	Unit	Range
parameter refers to the parameter as internally referred to in ExploreASL. 
Alias is the term it will be printed as by default in the  xASL_qc_GenerateReport. This should be a short descriptive name (~25 character max).
Description is a more elaborate description that can be printed if desired, not limited by character length (as of now not printed).
Unit is the unit that it is printed in.
Range is the range of acceptable values, this should be two values separated by a hyphen, eg. 0-100 for percentage based values.
