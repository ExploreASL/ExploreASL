% DESCRIPTION: This submodule aims to clean up WMH under- or oversegmentations in a conservatively & robust way,
% i.e. erring on the side of caution. It uses input from the tissue class segmentation (e.g. CAT12) to repair the
% WMH segmentation (e.g. LST LPA/LGA or externally provided). Note that before running the tissue segmentation, the T1w was
% (conservatively) filled for WMH lesions. % This function is not tested a lot, so mainly conservatively set up to improve the
% WMH volumetrics, rather than improve the registration.
%
% This submodule contains the following steps:
%
% 0. Administration
% 1. Correct pGM islands inside pWM
%    WMH can have an intensity similar to GM on the T1w, which erroneously classifies them as GM instead of WM(H).
%    The rule used here, is to define GM islands within the WM as clusters of pGM>0.05 for which 3 layers (dilations)
%    have at least 95% pWM. For these islands, pGM is given 100% to pWM. 50% of pWM is given to pWMH (the pWMH/pNAWM distinction is
%    made later in the pipeline, here still pWM=pWMH+pNAWM). The reason is that not all low T1w intensities within the WM
%    are WMH, we still expect some lacunes, perivascular (Virchow-Robin) spaces, which could be considered pNAWM rather than pWMH.
% 2. Perform brainmasking & join masks
% 3. Correct any WMH inside GM or CSF -> here we assume that CAT12 did a good segmentation job. If pGM is larger than pWM & larger
%    than pWMH, we consider a voxel to be pGM and remove the pWMH. This effectively removes pWMH segmentation noise in the GM or CSF,
%    it doesn't correct any significant misclassification of WMH in the GM or CSF. If the WMH segmentation does a significant misclassification
%    (e.g. setting the pWMH inside GM or CSF to a probability higher than GM or CSF is by tissue segmentation), this is lesion filled
%    after the WMH segmentation, on the T1w, hence the tissue segmentation won't have a chance to correct this. Fortunately, most
%    oversegmentations in the GM/CSF have low pWMH, as WMH segmentation algorithms already perform a light tissue prior-based
%    clean up themselves.
% 4. Saving & file management
% 5. Prepare visuals for visual QC & file management
