function xASL_wrp_ProcessM0(x)
%xASL_wrp_ProcessM0 Submodule of ExploreASL ASL Module, for M0 image processing
%
% FORMAT: xASL_wrp_ProcessM0(x)
%
% INPUT:
%   x       - structure containing fields with all information required to run this submodule (REQUIRED)
%   x.bRegisterM02ASL - boolean specifying whether M0 is registered to
%                     mean_control image (or T1w if no control image exists)
%                     It can be useful to disable M0 registration if the
%                     ASL registration is done based on the M0, and little
%                     motion is expected between the M0 and ASL
%                     acquisition.
%                     If no separate M0 image is available, this parameter
%                     will have no effect. This option is disabled
%                     automatically for 3D spiral
%                     (OPTIONAL, DEFAULT = 0)
%                     - 0 = M0 registration disabled
%                     - 1 = M0 registration enabled (DEFAULT)

% OUTPUT: n/a
% OUTPUT FILES: NIfTI containing image processed M0 map in native & standard space, with and without smoothing

% DESCRIPTION: This submodule performs the image processing and
%           quantification of M0 maps (if they exist), with the following steps:
%
%           1) Register M0 to mean control if it exists
%              Before registration, contrast is equalized between the
%              images & biasfields are removed
%           2) Quantify M0 (correction scale slope & incomplete T1 recovery)
%           3) Masking & smoothing of M0 image, either using:
%              A) traditional technique (very sharp masking & little smoothing)
%              B) new ExploreASL-specific technique:
%                 * extrapolating outside mask (avoiding artifacts from too
%                   much or too little masking)
%                 * smooth very extensively, to create a biasfield
%                   (increases robustness & comparison of M0 between
%                   sequences/patients)
%
%     Any M0 will be processed here. Even if part of the subjects does not
%     have an M0, since this can be later imputed, or an average population
%     M0 image could be used. Also, without background suppression and
%     without an M0, the MeanControl image is before saved as M0, and will
%     be processed here as well.
%
%     Note that any voxel-size differences between M0 and ASL are allowed
%     here: step 0B below rescales the PD inside an M0 voxel to the same as
%     the ASL resolution (assuming a voxel with half volume contains half
%     the amount of protons). The M0 is further processed in standard
%     space, and reduced to a biasfield. For the quantification in standard
%     space, the PWI and M0 are now by definition in the same space.
%     Also, the standard space M0 biasfield is resampled to the native PWI
%     space (at the end of step 3B), ensuring that both are also in the
%     same native space.
