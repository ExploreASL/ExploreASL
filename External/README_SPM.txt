//External/SPMmodified is a modified version of SPM12, CAT12 and LST, which is redistributed with the same license (GPL, see license files inside folders). This was developed parallel with ExploreASL, but is a separate project, with its own license.

In this textfile we list the modifications. This concerns the following versions:
SPM12, r7219 (/External/SPMmodified/Contents.txt)
CAT12, r1615 (/External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/CHANGES.txt)
LST, r2.0.15 (/External/SPMmodified/toolbox/LST/lst-version.txt)

Aside from the below list of code modifications, 
we have added new maps (//External/SPMmodified/MapsAdded/README_Maps.txt)
as well as new code (//External/SPMmodified/xASL/README_Functions.txt)

External/SPMmodified/toolbox/LST/ps_LST_lpa.m
115: First loads the xasl_quality parameter from the job, or set to default == 1
218: if xasl_quality is set to 0, load ps_LST_lpa_preproc_default_LowQ.m instead of ps_LST_lpa_preproc_default.m,
likewise if xasl_quality is set to 2 (when WMH_SEGM pre-exists), load ps_LST_lpa_preproc_default_UltraLowQ.m

DESCRIPTION:
Remove the link to the older versions like 1173, 1173plus, ,1445, 1585
FILE:
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/tbx_cfg_cat.m


DATE+NAME:2019_02_08, Jan Petr
DESCRIPTION:
Fixed the option for using and removing lesions from the CAT12 segmentation. Now the lesions are merged and prepared beforehand and the filename is passed to CAT, where this is loaded and all transformation steps are applied to it directly in CAT. Plus, CAT has some extra routines for working with the lesions, some of them were bypassed, because they were not working efficiently, when the lesion was set to NaN in the T1w image.
FILE:
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_conf_extopts.m
537     : Added xasl_lesion as a valid input for CAT12 containing the name of the merged lesion file
725,727,762 : Added xasl_lesion as a valid input for CAT12
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_defaults.m
197: Added the default value '' for the xasl_lesion
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_main_registration.m
407,638: The resliced lesion - ls - can contain NaNs due to reslicing - these must be removed before the mask is applied.
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_main_updateSPM.m
88 - We save our original lesion as LesionFull for later use, because the other lesion gets stripped (and this does not work when T1w has the lesion set to NaN by ExploreASL).
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_main.m
708 - calling the registration with the Full Lesion, that is not stripped (as the stripped one does not work when NaNs were set to T1w - because the WM segmentation is then missing there).
1390 - removing the lesion also when the xasl_lesion parameter was set. Few lines below - need to add apply the same transformations also to the non-stripped lesion. Do not divide it by
       255, as this makes it virtually unusable - no idea why CAT does that.
1434 - Not loading the lesions here anymore, but instead only saving original segmentation with xASL_im_SaveOriginal4CAT.
1448 - calling the segmentation again with the non-stripped lesions.
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_run_job1070.m
523 - We need to load our provided lesion, not use the CAT one (that's usually empty)

DATE+NAME:2019_01_30, Jan Petr
DESCRIPTION:
Added an option for saving the intermediate steps of the CAT12 registration at the end of the segmentation
(i.e. saving the lower quality intermediate DARTEL and GS transformation fields).
FILE:
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_conf_extopts.m
537     : Added xasl_savesteps as a valid input for CAT12
725,727,762 : Added xasl_savesteps as a valid input for CAT12
External/SPMmodified/toolbox/cat12/cat_main_registration.m
459: Added a call to function xASL_wrp_DARTELSaveReg that saves the current DARTEL registration flow field to a file - this function is ripped out of this CAT file
794: Added a call to function xASL_wrp_GSSaveReg that saves the current GS registration flow field to a file (only for the full resolution one) - this function is ripped out of this CAT file

DESCRIPTION:
Reseeding the random number generator for certain functions to make sure they run reproducibly.

BIDS/JSON

DATE+NAME:2020_03_12, JP
DESCRIPTION:
In DICOM header reader, removed the extra processing for CSASeriesHeaderInfo as the Phoenix Siemens protocol is saved under that DICOM tag and need a simple conversion to string. The type is redefined as LT in the External/SPMmodified/spm_dicom_dict.txt. Moreover, new DICOM fields are added at the end. The .mat dictionary is generated using a spm_dicom_text_to_dict('spm_dicom_dict.txt') command.

DESCRIPTION:
Error in the NIfTI header. 3D NIfTI files (dim[0] == 3) that have the size of the fourth dimension NT==1 (dim[4] == 1), but have TR defined (pixdim[4] ~= 1)

FILE:
jsmn.c at line 269

DATE+NAME:2021_01_12, JP
DESCRIPTION:
Edited the spm_jsonread.c so that spm_jsonread MEX correctly reads files that contain 0-character inside the text. A character with value 0 appears in some - otherwise empty - strings. 
Which causes that the JSON is not read entirely. We now read the entire JSON and replace 0 by a space.
