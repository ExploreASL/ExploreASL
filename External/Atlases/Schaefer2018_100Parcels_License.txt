Schaefer 100 parcellations atlas:
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Resting state fMRI data from 1489 subjects were registered using surface-based alignment. A gradient weighted markov random field approach was employed to identify cortical areas.

For each parcel resolution there are two nifti files corresponding to different versions of MNI space. FSLMNI152_1mm and FSLMNI152_2mm contain parcellations which are aligned with 2mm and 1mm MNI templates coming FSL. These two FSL MNI templates can be found under ${CBIG_CODE_DIR}/data/templates/volume/.

The parcellations were computed in fsaverage6 space and sampled to the volumetric MNI space. Each parcel was matched to a corresponding network in the 7 and 17 network parcellation by Yeo et al.
