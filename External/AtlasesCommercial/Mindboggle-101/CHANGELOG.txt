CHANGELOG for the Mindboggle-101 dataset:

2015-09-28: The OASIS-TRT-20 whole-brain subcortical labels had the 
original Neuromorphometrics numbers, so we converted them to FreeSurfer
label numbers for consistency (http://www.mindboggle.info/faq/labels.html).
The Mindboggle-101 joint fusion atlases were not impacted.

2015-02-22: We discovered and fixed a mistaken label in one of the 101
subjects:  the region corresponding to right isthmus cingulate in subject
NKI-RS-22-16 was incorrectly labeled as inferior temporal, so in that
hemisphere, there were two separate regions with the "inferior temporal"
label. The Mindboggle-101 joint fusion atlases were not impacted since
they were constructed without use of this subject.

2014-10-18: Included summary information about the scans:
http://mindboggle.info/data/mindboggle101_extras/scans_info.tar.gz

2014-09-29: Fixed the alignment of subcortical and cortical labels in the
individual OASIS-TRT-20 whole-brain label volumes. Constructed a new joint
fusion atlas from these combined label volumes (hardly any change).
Both are called "version 2". The cortical labels were unaffected. 
It turns out there was a discrepancy between the IDs assigned to the 
MICCAI2012 challenge / BrainCOLOR volumes and the renumbered OASIS-TRT-20
volumes, so some of the transforms were applied to the wrong subcortical labels.
Fortunately, there is extremely little difference from the earlier version.

2014-03-26: The subcortical labels in the OASIS-TRT-20 whole-brain label
set were discovered to be out of alignment for many of the 20 brains.  
We have removed the link to these labeled volumes until the source of the
problem is found. <FIXED on 2014-09-29>

2014-01-08: Replaced all Atropos template priors again (error found).
Updated antsCorticalThickness.sh call in README.

2013-12-19: Replaced all Atropos template priors that include cerebella
and brainstem, and segmented volumes with 6 classes (GM, WM, CSF, deep GM,
cerebella, brainstem).

2013-10-04: Added new 2mm resampled versions the OASIS-30 template and joint
fusion atlas, along with the Python resampling script.  Thanks, Satrajit Ghosh!

2013-10-04: Updated the OASIS-TRT-20 jointfusion atlas and corresponding files.
Now includes labels and probabilities in OASIS-30 Atropos template as well as
MNI space.

2013-09-12: Added corresponding 2mm versions of joint fusion atlas and
Atropos template. Thanks, Satrajit Ghosh!

2013-09-11: Replaced joint fusion atlas originally built with ANTS-registered
brains with antsRegistration-registered Atropos-cropped brains using the
latest antsCorticalThickness.sh.

2013-09-06: Replaced head templates built using buildtemplateparallel.sh 
in ANTs with new ones built using antsMultivariateTemplateConstruction.sh.

2013-09-05: Replaced outdated Atropos template with newer templates
constructed by Nicholas Tustison (for use with antsAtroposN4.sh).

2013-08-22: Added 2mm versions of template and joint fusion atlas:
  - OASIS-TRT-20_template_in_MNI152_2mm.nii.gz
  - OASIS-TRT-20_DKT31_CMA_jointfusion_atlas_in_MNI152_2mm.nii.gz
Thanks, Satrajit Ghosh!

2013-08-21: Converted all OASIS-TRT-20 subcortical labels to conform to 
FreeSurfer's label values.  Five labels did not have counterparts and were 
assigned to unused numbers in FreeSurferColorLUT.txt:
cerebellar vermal lobules (630-632) and basal forebrain (91-92).
Rebuilt the joint fusion atlases accordingly, and updated the scripts.
<FIXED on 2014-09-29>

2013-08-20: Replaced corrupted FreeSurfer .mgz files for the HLN-12 subjects.

2013-07-30: Included a new description of the protocol with sulcus and gyrus 
label lists and corresponding label numbers in the protocol.txt file.

2013-07-26: We have created a joint fusion atlas and label probability volume 
from the manually labeled OASIS-TRT-20 brains!

2013-07-12: We have combined manually labeled OASIS-TRT-20 cortical, subcortical, 
and cerebellar labels!  <FIXED on 2014-09-29>

2013-06-26: Corrected orientation of OASIS-TRT-20_template.nii.gz 
and included an MNI152-registered version.

2013-05-11: Fixed nifti volume labels for the Colin27-1 brain. Thanks, Bob Cox!

2013-04-27: We have included manually labeled OASIS-TRT-20 subcortical volumes!

2013-02-17: VERTICES section removed from surface VTK files
The VERTICES section of the labeled surface VTK files are not necessary,
and were improperly formatted, so they have been removed.

2013-02-09: MNI152-registered volume data replaced
A couple of images were found not to have registered properly to the MNI152 
template (MMRR-21-1 and -21) using FSL's flirt, so all of the brain images 
were registered again using ANTS instead.

2013-01-08: Volume data replaced
Label images were accidentally placed in the OASIS-TRT-20_volumes/ and 
NKI-RS-22_volumes/ folders as t1weighted_brain.nii.gz files, and the
MNI152-registered label volumes were transformed using trilinear vs. nearest
neighbor interpolation.  We rewrote the software that postprocesses the
whole-head and label data (now included in the new Supplementary Material online)
that not only corrects these errors, but also improves upon the brain extraction
using both the manual cortical as well as the automated subcortical labels.
