- This TestDataSet is created by bringing the scanner-average T1, FLAIR, Control, M0 and CBF images into native space, and computing back the source NIfTIs. The average data are from a Philips Achieva 3.0T scanner from the VUmc, Amsterdam UMC, from healthy elderly participants; acquired as part of the EPAD study, which has received support from the EU/EFPIA IMI Joint Undertakings grant no. 115736.
