This folder contains atlases with ROIs, that can be used by ExploreASL to get average (or other statistics) over a single or multiple Regions-Of-Interest (ROIs).

The atlases inside /LicensePermissive can be used freely for all purposes.
The atlases inside /LicenseLimited can only be used freely for non-commercial purposes.

All atlases need to be cited when used in a publication, and licenses need to be respected.
