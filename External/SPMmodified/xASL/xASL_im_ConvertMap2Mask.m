function [IMout] = xASL_im_ConvertMap2Mask(IMin)
%xASL_im_ConvertMap2Mask Provides a robust way of conversion of 
% a continuous map to a binary mask, which can be used for lesions, ROIs,
% or tissue probability maps. Based on the assumption that a map should
% be thresholded at 50% to form a map, which is often the case for
% automatic segmentations
%
% Explanation: taking the 0.5 could give a too strict mask, if there are a few high outliers
%  in case of interpolation overshoots or other causes for extreme values
%  (vascular peaks?). Masking at 0.5* the 0.95 percentile value instead of 1
%  (absolute max) helps, but doesn't work if a lot of low values have
%  occurred through smoothing from interpolation. A pragmatic solution is
%  too first make the strict mask, take the 0.95 percentile from this and
%  use half of its value.

% DESCRIPTION: Provides a robust way of conversion of 
% a continuous map to a binary mask, which can be used for lesions, ROIs,
% or tissue probability maps. Based on the assumption that a map should
% be thresholded at 50% to form a map, which is often the case for
% automatic segmentations.
%
% EXAMPLE: n/a
%
% Example cases:
% Eg 1: in the case of a tissue probability map (SPM12/CAT12), this gives
% 0.5
%
% Eg 2: in the case of a downsampled (B-spline interpolated, native to
% standard space) this gives 0.5337 (simple half value would be 0.69)
%
% Eg 3: In case of already a mask, this gives 0.5 (i.e. leaves mask
% unchanged)
%
% Eg 4: In case of a probability segmentation (WMH PreDiva), this gives 0.5
%
% Eg 5: In case of a B-spline downsampled (native2MNI) probability
% segmentation (WMH PreDiva), this gives 0.5547 (simple half value would be
% 0.66)
%
% Eg 6: In case of the original functional ROI (fMRI activation), this
% gives 21.2 (simple half value would gives 29.8, real minimum of the ROI is 21.8))
%
% Eg 7: In case of 4rd degree B-spline interpolated functional ROI, this
% gives 21.2 (simple half value would give 29.6)
%
% Eg 8: In case of trilinear interpolated functional ROI, this
% gives 20.8 (simple half value would give 28.8)
%
% Eg 9: In case of nearest neighbor interpolated functional ROI, this
% gives 21.5 (simple half value would give 29.8)
%
