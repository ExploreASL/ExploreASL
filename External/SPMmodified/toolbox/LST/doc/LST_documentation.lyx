\begin_layout Section*
Introduction
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The toolbox "LST: Lesion Segmentation Tool" is an open source toolbox for
 SPM that is able to segment T2 hyperintense lesions in FLAIR images.
 Originally developed for the segmentation of MS lesions it has has also
 been proven to be useful for the segmentation of brain lesions in the context
 of other diseases, such as diabetes mellitus or Alzheimer's disease.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, there are two algorithms implemented for lesion segmentation.
 The first, a lesion growth algorithm (LGA), requires a T1 image in addition
 to the FLAIR image.
 The second algorithm, a lesion prediction algorithm (LPA), requires a FLAIR
 image only but is currently still in beta mode.
 As a third highlight a pipeline allowing the longitudinal segmentation
 is implemented.
 In addition, the toolbox can be used to fill lesions in any image modility.
 We hope that these algorithms will be able to contribute to current research
 in MS and other disciplines.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The toolbox was developed by a cooperation of the following organizations:
 Morphometry Group, Department of Neurology, Technische Universität München
 (TUM), Munich, Germany; Department of Statistics, Ludwig-Maximilians-University
, Munich, Germany; and Structural Brain Mapping Group, Departments of Neurology
 and Psychiatry, Friedrich-Schiller-University, Jena, Germany.

\begin_layout Subsection
License
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The LST toolbox is available to the scientific community under the terms
 of the GNU General Public License.
 A copy of the GNU General Public License is received along with this toolbox.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Installation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To install the LST toolbox, visit the toolbox-website and download the zipped
 folder LST_x.x.x.zip, where x.x.x may be replaced by the newest version of the
 toolbox.
 Unzip the folder into the SPM12 toolbox folder.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Starting the toolbox
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
To start the toolbox, run MATLAB and SPM12.
 Select LST from the drop-down menu of the toolbox-button.
 The toolbox will open in SPM’s second window.
 By clicking on 
\begin_inset Quotes eld
\end_inset

LST
\begin_inset Quotes erd
\end_inset

, access to different parts of the toolbox is given.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Preparation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Before segmenting lesions for several subjects it is advisable to put some
 thought in the organization of your data and the structure of folders on
 your disk.
 In our experience it is best to create one folder for each subject (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
subj01
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
subj02
\family default
, ...).
 Keep the names of the images simple (e.g.
 
\family typewriter
t1.nii
\family default
 and 
\family typewriter
flair.nii
\family default
) and free from any personal information of the patient.
 If images for multiple time points are available they may be all in the
 same folder but clearly distinguishable (e.g.

\family typewriter
 t1_01.nii
\family default
, 
\family typewriter
t1_02.nii
\family default
, ...) or in seperate folders.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Referencing LST
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
We put a lot of effort in the creation of this toolbox, so please cite it
 accordingly.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Minimal version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you used the LGA, please use something similar to the following paragraph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Lesions were segmented by the lesion growth algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schmidt2012automated"

\end_inset

 as implemented in the LST toolbox version x.x.x (www.statistical-modelling.de/lst.ht
ml) for SPM.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, mentioning how the optimal initial threshold was determined
 is advised.
 If this was done by visual inspection, then just add this information.
 If you compared the segmentations to reference images, then please provide
 some details about how these images were obtained and what metric you used
 for comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If lesions have been segmented by the LPA instead, please use something
 like the following paragraph:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Lesions were segmented by the lesion prediction algorithm as implemented
 in the LST toolbox version x.x.x (www.statistical-modelling.de/lst.html) for
 SPM.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, please add information about the images you used, i.e.
 did you use the FLAIR images only or did you also use reference images?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If you used the longitudinal pipeline then it is best to first explain the
 independent lesion segmentation by one of the suggestions given above.
 You can then add something like the following:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Segmented lesion maps of different time points were compared using the longitudi
nal pipeline implemented in the LST toolbox.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
More detailed version
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Feel free to use the following paragraphs if you want or need to explain
 the algorithms in more detail.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the LGA use a paragraph such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Lesions were segmented by the lesion growth algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schmidt2012automated"

\end_inset

 as implemented in the LST toolbox version x.x.x (www.statistical-modelling.de/lst.ht
ml) for SPM.
 The algorithm first segments the T1 images into the three main tissue classes
 (CSF, GM and WM).
 This information is then combined with the coregistered FLAIR intensities
 in order to calculate lesion belief maps.
 By thresholding these maps with a pre-chosen initial threshold (
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

) an initial binary lesion map is obtained which is subsequently grown along
 voxels that appear hyperintense in the FLAIR image.
 The result is a lesion probability map.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, please mention how the optimal initial threshold was determined.
 If this was done by visual inspection, then just add this information.
 If you compared the segmentations to reference images, then please provide
 some details about how these images were obtained and what metric you used
 for comparison.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
For the LPA use a paragraph such as
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Lesions were segmented by the lesion prediction algorithm as implemented
 in the LST toolbox version x.x.x (www.statistical-modelling.de/
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

lst.html) for SPM.
 This algorithm consists of a binary classifier in the form of a logistic
 regression model trained on the data of 53 MS patients with severe lesion
 patterns.
 Data were obtained at the Department of Neurology, Technische Universität
 München, Munich, Germany.
 As covariates for this model a similar lesion belief map as for the lesion
 growth algorithm 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation
LatexCommand citep
key "schmidt2012automated"

\end_inset

 was used as well as a spatial covariate that takes into account voxel specific
 changes in lesion probability.
 Parameters of this model fit are used to segment lesions in new images
 by providing an estimate for the lesion probability for each voxel.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Here, please add information about the images you used, i.e.
 did you use the FLAIR images only or did you also use reference images?
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
A more detailed version for the longitudinal pipeline is given next:
\end_layout

\begin_layout Quote
Segmented lesion maps of different time points were compared using the longitudi
nal pipeline implemented in the LST toolbox.
 This pipeline consists of the following steps: First, lesion maps and FLAIR
 images are coregistered to the images of the first time point.
 In the next step, relative differences of FLAIR intensities are calculated
 along all voxels that were segmented as lesions in at least one time point.
 Finally, significant increase and decrease of lesion voxels are identified
 if their differences exceed or fall below a certain threshold that is obtained
 by analyzing healthy white matter.
 As a final result, lesion change labels are produced for all consecutive
 time points.
 In these images the three possible cases decrease, no change and increase
 are labeled by the numbers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Section
Lesion segmentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Currently, there are two algorithms implemented for the segmentation of
 lesions, the LGA and the LPA.
 In addition, a longitudinal pipeline is available.
 The usage of these methods is explained in the following subsections.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lesion growth algorithm (LGA)

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
This section deals with the lesion growth algorithm (LGA) as presented in

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsubsection
Segmentation
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesion segmentation by the LGA requires a T1 and a FLAIR image.
 Furthermore, the user has to specify an initial threshold, 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

.
 If the algorithm is applied for the first time to new data we recommend
 to choose different values for 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 (e.g.
 in the range of 0.05 to 1.0 with an increment of 0.05) and to obtain the best
 value by either visual inspection of the results or by the comparison with
 reference segmentations, if available.
 For the latter strategy we implemented a special routine, see section 
\begin_inset CommandInset ref
LatexCommand ref
reference "sub:Determination-of-the"

\end_inset

.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The user needs to select the original T1 and FLAIR images for each subject.
 The FLAIR images must be in the same order as the T1 images.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Options
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The main parameter that needs to be set by the user is 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 (Initial threshold).
 In addition, the user can specify the strength of the Markov random field
 (MRF parameter) as well as the maximum number of iterations (Maximum iterations
) for the LGA.
 While we do not recommend to change the former parameter the maximum number
 of iterations should be increased if it reaches its limit during the segmentati
on process.
 Finally, the user can choose if the results of the segmentation should
 be summarized in a HTML report.
 Although it needs a while to produce this report we recommend its usage
 as it makes it easier to check the results.

\begin_layout Standard
The LGA returns a bias corrected version of the FLAIR image (
\family typewriter
rm[FLAIR]
\begin_inset Newline linebreak
\end_inset

\family default
) that is coregistered to the T1 image as well as a lesion probability map
 (
\family typewriter
ples_lga_[

 In addition, a .mat-file (
\family typewriter

\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

]_rm[FLAIR] .mat
\family default
) is produced which contains all necessary components that are needed for
 a re-run of the algorithm, the longitudinal pipeline, or for lesion filling.
 If the user decided to do so a HTML report (
\family typewriter
report_LST_lga_[
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

]_rm[FLAIR].html
\family default
) is saved as well as a folder that contains images that are displayed in
 the report.

Determination of the optimal initial threshold

\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
With this module we offer the opportunity to determine the optimal 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$
\end_inset

 based on the Dice coefficient, see 
\begin_inset CommandInset citation

\end_inset

 for details.
 This requires the existence of reference segmentations to be compared with
 the lesion maps.
 These reference images are a binary images in the space of the T1 images
 where a 1 indicates a lesion.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
As input the user needs to choose the binary reference images.
 The algorithm automatically searches the folder of each reference image
 for lesion probability maps obtained by LGA, thus for each patient the
 reference images need to be in the same folder as the lesion probability
 maps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph

 The CSV file contains columns for the folder of the reference images, the
 name of the FLAIR images, the value of 
\begin_inset Formula $\kappa$

\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Lesion prediction algorithm (LPA)
\begin_inset CommandInset label
LatexCommand label
name "sub:LPA"

\end_inset


\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
Lesion segmentation by the LPA requires a FLAIR image only.
 However, the user is free to choose an additional image that serves as
 a reference image during a coregistration step before the main lesion segmentat
ion.
 This may be helpful if the dimension of the FLAIR image is low or if the
 goal of the lesion segmentation is to fill lesions in T1 images.
 Beside that no additional parameters need to be set.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Input
\end_layout

As input the user needs to choose the original FLAIR images.
 Additional reference images can be chosen but must be in the same order

\begin_layout Paragraph
Output
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
If no reference image has been specified this algorithm saves a bias corrected
 version of the FLAIR image (
\family typewriter
m[FLAIR].nii
\family default
).
 If a reference image has been chosen the bias corrected coregistered FLAIR
 image (
\family typewriter
mr[FLAIR].nii
\family default
) is saved.
 Besides the lesion probability map (
\family typewriter
ples_lpa_m[r][FLAIR].nii
\family default
) an additional .mat-file (
\family typewriter
LST_lpa_m[r][FLAIR].mat
\family default
) is produced which contains all necessary components that are needed for
 the longitudinal pipeline or for lesion filling.
 If the user decided to do so a HTML report (
\family typewriter
report_LST_lpa_m[r][FLAIR].html
\family default
) is saved as well as a folder that contains images that are displayed in
 the report.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Subsection
Longitudinal pipeline
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The longitudinal pipeline is able to compare segmented lesion maps for different
 time points.
 The segmentations can be derived either by the LGA or the LPA, but not
 both.
 Furthermore, it is required that the FLAIR images and .mat-files that are
 saved during the lesion segmentation process are available in the same
 folders as the lesions probability maps.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
The pipeline proceeds by comparing all consecutive time points in an iterative
 manner.
 It decides if changes in lesion structure are significant or due to natural
 variations of the FLAIR signal.
 Non-significant changes are labeled as lesions in both probability maps,
 thus, probability lesion maps are corrected within this procedure and may
 differ from the ones that served as input.
 As a final result, lesion change labels are produced for all consecutive
 time points.
 In these images the three possible cases decrease, no change and increase
 are labeled by the numbers 1, 2, and 3, respectively.
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
In addition, a lesion change plot is constructed.
 This plot shows the lesion volumes for both time points of all segmented
 lesions.
 This way it is easy to recognize how the lesion structure has been changed,
 i.e.
 if the change occurred by the appearance of new lesions, the disappearance
 of old lesions, by the change of already existing lesions, or a combination
 of these possibilities.
 
\end_layout

\begin_layout Paragraph
Input
\end_layout

\begin_layout Standard
First, the user needs to create one item for each time point.
 Then, lesion probability maps for each time point need to be selected.
 For all time points the images must be in the same order.
