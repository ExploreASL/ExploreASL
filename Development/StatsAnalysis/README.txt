This folder contains functions that can be used for statistical comparisons, but are not included in the basic ExploreASL functionality.
They are not curated/revamped to ExploreASL's code standards.

/SPM_VBA_Stats/* performs voxel-based analyses, potentially with mixed models (see clinical GENFI ASL paper, Mutsaerts, 2019 Brain).
/StatTestCompare/* previous work by HM at KCL, IoP, to compare performance statistical voxel-based models for ASL
/ROI_Stats/* iterates over ROIs/subjects/sessions/runs/etc to compare groups, also used by SPM_VBA_Stats
